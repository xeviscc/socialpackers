  MISSION
  </b></p>
  <p>
  HEC Paris’ mission is twofold: training the global leaders of tomorrow, and taking an active part in the production of knowledge on management.
  </p>
  <p>
  Created in 1881 by the Paris Chamber of Commerce and Industry, HEC Paris ambitions to train high potential individuals, capable of becoming architects of a responsible world. What makes HEC unique is its conviction shared by the HEC Community: knowledge determines the freedom and entrepreneurship required for a better world. This conviction is affirmed with our motto “The more you know, the more you dare”.

  This mission is based on two pillars: a rigorous research environment and close connections to the corporate world. The combination of high quality research, underlying the pedagogical innovation at HEC Paris, and close corporate connections, gives the HEC community the necessary tools and background to challenge established rules and to invent the new social and economic paradigms of tomorrow’s world, rather than simply reproduce them.
